# Onboarding

"Best thing to do with the new developers is to size them up with a long stare." - The IT Crowd S1E1

Some of the points here are valid for new hires on the team or devs switching between projects.

Developers live on the basic principles of :
1. Empathy
2. Inquisitiveness
3. Humility
4. *GET SHIT DONE*

Keep this in mind when we have new developers joining. We want them to feel wanted and empowered. As we onboard developers they are being on-boarded by developers too. Remember the principles we live on are the same principles we want the team to thrive on.

Below are the few things we need to do for On-boarding teams / developers onto projects.

## Empathy
- The ability to understand and share the feelings of others

Introduce the new dev to the team, take him/her out for a drink make them feel welcome on the first day and  introduce them to the entire team.

For new hires lets help them get through the administrative process. Take them around the office to the different areas of business or at the least try.

Make sure they are invited to the agile ceremonies, slack teams and if any email groups they need to be added to.

## Inquisitiveness
- Given to inquiry, research, or asking questions; eager for knowledge; intellectually curious: an inquisitive mind. unduly or inappropriately curious; prying.

Every developer wants to learn. Get them on top of the project, go through the processes, share the documentation you have or not have. Get them a brain dump of code, documentation and processes. A developer is inquisitive he wants to figure things out as he works on the project. Don't drop a bomb or if you do give them some space to be inquisitive to understand the system and let them slither through the complexities.

No question is a bad question, don't spoon feed them the solution let them question and get answers of you.

## Humility
- The quality of having a modest or low view of one's importance.

A new person on the team is not an extra resource to help but an extra heart to pump blood into the system. Introduce them on processes but be open to things that may not be right. They are coming with new knowledge new ways of working, they might bring better quality into the system.

Make them feel empowered, let them criticise things they don't like. Let them be the drivers of change thats how leaders are born.

## GET SHIT DONE
- ACCOMPLISHMENT

All developers want to GET SHIT DONE, which is the most important thing for them.
