Tests are a great occasion not just to enforce your code but also to communicate or explain choices to other developers.

Tests, if well written and sufficiently covering the code, creates and pseudo documentation for the code itself and due to the fact that need to be updated when the code change, it's also simpler to keep in sync/updated than the traditional documentation.

ADD EXAMPLES HERE.
